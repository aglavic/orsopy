Minutes
-------

1. Should we bring ``slddb`` (`slddb link`_) into the main ``orsopy`` package and if so how should this be achieved?
  - The original purpose of ``orsopy`` is a place for all code related to ORSO packages, not just to serve the ``fileio`` functionality. 
    However, it is important to be careful in future when selecting what should and should not be included in the package. 
  - There was a discussion regarding the differences between ``slddb`` and the ``periodictable`` package. 
    AG noted that the primary purpose of ``slddb`` is to be a database for scattering length densities which is the maiin distinction. 
    Additionally, AG identified the value to packaging ``slddb`` within ``orsopy`` that analysis packages would only require a single dependency to access the benefits of both. 
  - The importance of not adding a database to the ``orsopy`` package was raised by BM, however, AG pointed out that the Python package for accessing the database as already well divorced from the database. 
    This removed BM's original worries regarding merging the projects. 
  - AN commented that it is important to be clear on the process that would change the value of a member of the database. 
    It was suggested that the documentation on this process which is present on the ``slddb`` web interface about_ page, could be mirrored in the ``orsopy`` documentation. 
  - It was broadly agreed that bringing the ``slddb`` python code into ``orsopy`` was a good idea and it should be done by adding the package as a second submodule, i.e. ``orsopy.slddb``. 
2. Should there be a standard formatting that we agree to in ``orsopy`` and if so what should the rules be?
  - AN introduced the motivation for collaborative projects towards having a common code style (via formatting rules). 
  - It was broadly agreed that a common style is beneficial, however, AG would like to see it applied in a soft fashion, i.e. a pull request does not fail for the wrong style (this could be offputting to new contributors). 
  - AN and AM both felt strongly that incorrectly formatted could should not be able to be merged, however, agree that it should be clear **why** the tests have failed. 



Actions
-------

- Move the ``slddb` code to the ``orsopy`` repository (AG).
- Mirror the relevant documentation for finding problems in the ``slddb`` in the ``orsopy`` documentation (AG).
